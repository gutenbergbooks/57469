<h2 class="nobreak">AN UNWELCOME CALLER</h2></div>


<p>Rap! rap! rap! It was past midnight
and some one was knocking on Doctor
Rabbit&#8217;s door. Doctor Rabbit growled a
little, for he did not like to be wakened
that time of night even if he was a doctor.
But he got up anyway and opened the
upstairs window in his big tree.</p>

<p>The big round moon was shining very
bright. It shone quite clear on the one
who was knocking at the door. Now,
who do you suppose it was? Well, it
was some one Doctor Rabbit didn&#8217;t want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
to see. I should say he didn&#8217;t! For it
was Tom Wildcat knocking! And he
was about the worst enemy Doctor
Rabbit had in the Big Green Woods. So
it was a mighty good thing he didn&#8217;t
go down and open his front door.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you want at my house this
time o&#8217; night?&#8221; Doctor Rabbit called
down sharply.</p>

<p>Tom Wildcat jumped back a little, he
was so surprised to hear some one talking
above him. &#8220;Oh!&#8221; he exclaimed, looking
up. &#8220;How do you do, Doctor Rabbit?
I just came over to have you put some
salve on my hind foot. I hurt it pretty
bad a while ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Doctor Rabbit didn&#8217;t believe old
Tom. So he said, &#8220;Well, that doesn&#8217;t
interest me, but how did you hurt it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Tom Wildcat, &#8220;I stepped
on something in the dark&mdash;a sticker or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
something. Then all of a sudden I
found my foot bleeding and mighty sore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit knew very well how
very cunning Tom was, so he spoke right
up and said, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t tell me the
real truth I won&#8217;t look at your foot
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>That was pretty plain and Tom Wildcat
saw there was no other way but to tell
the truth. &#8220;Well,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the fact is
I was borrowing a hen from Farmer Roe&#8217;s
chicken house, and his big dog and I had
a little trouble before I could get away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Aha, I see,&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit,
peering slyly down at Tom and looking
very wise. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll just shut my window
and you can come up. You&#8217;ll find
a small hole under the window. Put
your foot through it and I&#8217;ll look at it.&#8221;
Then Doctor Rabbit shut the window,
locked it, and sat down to wait.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>Tom grumbled more than a little about
having to climb the tree with his sore
foot, but as there was no other way he
began pulling and clawing into the bark,
and up he went. Every now and then
he hurt his foot against the tree and
would have to stop. This made him
pretty mad. But by and by he got up
to the window and there he stopped to
rest a bit and get his breath.</p>

<p>Then he looked at the hole under the
window and called out, &#8220;What are you
going to do with my foot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how can I tell till I see it?&#8221;
Doctor Rabbit called back. And all the
while he was chuckling so much he was
afraid Tom might hear.</p>

<p>After thinking it over Tom had decided
that perhaps he could put his foot
through the hole and at the same time
look through the window and see what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Doctor Rabbit was doing. But there
was no way he could do this. So he
turned round with his head down and
held on to the bark of the tree while he
put his foot through the hole under the
window.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit saw right away that
Tom Wildcat&#8217;s foot really was sore, but
it wasn&#8217;t very bad. So chuckling more
than ever, he went to his medicine closet
and got out a box of salve. It was what
Doctor Rabbit called his hot medicine,
and it certainly was hot. It would cure
a sore foot all right, but Doctor Rabbit
didn&#8217;t use it very often. He kept it only
for some one like his present patient.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up!&#8221; Tom called out most
impatiently.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit was all ready, so he
called back, &#8220;All right there, Tom; hold
right still!&#8221; and slapped a lot of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
hot salve right on the sore foot, just
where it hurt the most.</p>

<p>Old Tom gave a yell loud enough to
be heard all over the Big Green Woods,
and down the tree he went.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTOR RABBIT DISCOVERS A
SECRET</h2></div>


<p>When Tom Wildcat reached the ground
he was pretty mad. Doctor Rabbit
opened his window again and called down
to him. &#8220;That salve is pretty hot, I&#8217;m
afraid, but I&#8217;m quite sure it&#8217;ll cure your
foot. Yes, sir, it&#8217;s pretty hot, but it&#8217;s
just the right kind of salve for a wildcat!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe it is,&#8221; growled Tom
Wildcat between his teeth. Then, thinking
perhaps the salve would cure his foot
and that by and by he might deceive
Doctor Rabbit, he added, in a very
pleasant tone, &#8220;I&#8217;m very much obliged
to you, Doctor Rabbit. Good night!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good night to you, Tom,&#8221; Doctor
Rabbit said, still chuckling to himself
as he closed his window and locked it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>Doctor Rabbit was wide awake now
and did not care to go back to bed. So
he put on his light coat and soft slippers
and sat down in his big rocking chair.
Then he had a good laugh when he
thought of the way Tom Wildcat yelped
as he went down the tree.</p>

<p>But pretty soon Doctor Rabbit stopped
rocking and sat up very straight and
listened. Yes, sir! There was some one
mumbling in the little thicket near his
back door. Doctor Rabbit got up and
quietly slipped down his stairway. He
crept close to his kitchen door and listened.
It was just as he thought. Tom
Wildcat was out there, talking and laughing
to himself.</p>

<p>He was saying, &#8220;My foot surely does
burn but I know it&#8217;s going to be better.&#8221;
After a minute he went on, &#8220;I believe
I&#8217;ll rest here a little. I might just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
well. Ha, ha, ha! That fat old Doctor
Rabbit is in bed sleeping his head off.
He thinks he&#8217;s pretty cunning, but he&#8217;s
not half as cunning as I am. Ha! ha!
ha! I should say not. Yes, I&#8217;ll just
rest here for a bit and think about the
really, truly dinner I&#8217;m going to have.
Jack Rabbit surely will make a fine one.
Indeed he will!&#8221;</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTOR RABBIT KEEPS STILL
AND LISTENS</h2></div>


<p>When Doctor Rabbit heard Tom Wildcat
say he was going to have his friend
Jack Rabbit for dinner, he listened with
all his ears to hear, if possible, how Tom
expected to catch poor innocent Jack
Rabbit. The wily Tom, thinking Doctor
Rabbit was asleep, kept right on talking.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s mighty lucky,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that
I found where Jack Rabbit takes his nap.
Ha! ha! ha! Right under the big sycamore
tree. It will be as easy as anything
to catch him. Along about noon he&#8217;ll
be asleep there, and I&#8217;ll just creep up
behind that big tree. Then I&#8217;ll slip
up into the tree and walk out on that
long limb, right over him; and then,
kerplunk! I&#8217;ll pounce down on him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
Yum! yum! yum! I can almost taste
him now! I&#8217;ll hurry home this minute
and see that Kit Wildcat has the water
boiling and everything ready. By dinner
time I&#8217;ll be as hungry as a bear!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; Tom Wildcat suddenly cried
out, and then he said, &#8220;Whew!&#8221; softly.
You see, he had licked his sore foot and
the salve burned his tongue. &#8220;That
salve is certainly hot,&#8221; he said; but as
he was thinking about fat Jack Rabbit
he didn&#8217;t even complain. He was feeling
pretty good again, and he went
slipping along through the moonlit woods
toward his home. Every now and then
a twig or a vine brushed against his long
whiskers and he turned aside quickly.
Tom Wildcat&#8217;s whiskers help him a great
deal after dark. They often protect his
eyes from sticks and briars and tell him
when a hole is big enough to go through.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>When slinky Tom had got a little distance
away, Doctor Rabbit opened the
door just enough so that he could peek
out. Tom Wildcat would creep along a
little distance, then stop and listen and
look all around. Once he crawled close
to the ground and made a sudden spring.
Jack Rabbit gave a great jump and came
very near being caught, but he darted
away just in the nick of time. Tom stood
for a moment jerking his tail from side to
side and muttering his disappointment;
then trotted out of sight among the
shadows.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i025.jpg" alt="Mr. Jack Rabbit came very
near being caught" /></div>
<p class="caption">Mr. Jack Rabbit ... came very
near being caught</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit closed the door and
went back to his big rocking chair. He
could scarcely wait until daylight to run
over and warn his friend Jack Rabbit.
Doctor Rabbit knew well enough that
there was a nice sunny spot under the
big sycamore tree at the edge of the Big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Green Woods, and he knew Jack Rabbit
often stretched out to sun himself there
after he had eaten some of the tender
blue grass. The fact was, Doctor Rabbit
himself had stretched out there a number
of times.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit didn&#8217;t even wait to get
breakfast. Just as soon as it began to
be daylight he started through the woods
to see Jack Rabbit, out on the Wide
Prairie. &#8220;I certainly hope I shall find
Friend Jack at home,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit
said as he hurried along.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTOR RABBIT SPEAKS TO
JACK RABBIT</h2></div>


<p>It was a pretty long distance from
Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s home in the big tree to
Jack Rabbit&#8217;s home out in the Wide
Prairie. As Doctor Rabbit went along
through the Big Green Woods, he moved
watchful-like, because he thought Tom
Wildcat might be prowling around almost
anywhere. When there was a nice open
glade in the woods, Doctor Rabbit went
hoppity, hoppity, hoppity, as fast as his
legs would carry him, and he held his
ears flat to his head, too, for that&#8217;s the
way Doctor Rabbit and all other rabbits
hold their ears when they run very fast.
Then he would stop and prick up his
ears and listen for the least sound.</p>

<p>Presently he met Blue Jay.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>&#8220;Good morning, Doctor Rabbit!&#8221; Blue
Jay cried out, a great deal louder than
Doctor Rabbit wished him to.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit said softly, &#8220;Sh! Good
morning, Blue Jay. But not so loud!
Tom Wildcat might&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is he?&#8221; Blue Jay asked, and
his voice trembled with fear and anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sh!&#8221; Doctor Rabbit warned again.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know just exactly <i>where</i> he is
now but he was prowling around my
house last night, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yesterday,&#8221; poor Blue Jay interrupted,
&#8220;he was prowling around <i>my</i>
house. I came home just in time to hear
Jenny Jay screaming her loudest because
he had nearly caught her. And then
what do you suppose he did? He ate
every egg we had in our nest! We
wanted to peck his eyes out, but we
didn&#8217;t dare to get close enough. We&#8217;re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
building a new nest in another tree now,
and I&#8217;m watching for Tom Wildcat every
minute. I just want to tell him what I
think of him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk so loud, please, Blue Jay,&#8221;
Doctor Rabbit said again, in a low voice.
&#8220;He might be around close, and I don&#8217;t
want him to see me, especially just at
this time. I&#8217;m on my way to see Jack
Rabbit on very important business.
Now, Blue Jay, slip around as quick as
you can and tell Stubby Woodchuck and
Cheepy Chipmunk, and our other friends,
that Tom Wildcat is in the Big Green
Woods again, and very hungry, too. I
have thought of a way to get rid of him,
<i>perhaps</i>; but first I shall have to see
whether my plan works out.&#8221; And
without taking time to say another word,
Doctor Rabbit hurried away through the
woods toward Jack Rabbit&#8217;s home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Blue Jay flew straight to the stump
where Stubby Woodchuck lived and told
him to look out for Tom Wildcat; then
he went around and told Cheepy Chipmunk,
and Robin-the-Red, and Chatty
Red Squirrel. They told <i>their</i> neighbors,
so that in a little time they all were talking
and thinking about Tom Wildcat.
You see, all the little creatures of the
Big Green Woods are dreadfully afraid of
old Tom Wildcat, because not only can
he spring quickly on the ground, but he
can climb trees very swiftly.</p>

<p>Tom Wildcat lived in a very large
cottonwood tree over by the Deep River.
He prowled around over there, eating
whatever he could find. Sometimes he
caught a fish at the edge of Deep River,
and now and then he caught a hen that
wandered down along the bank. He was
satisfied with such things for a time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
but every now and then he slipped into
the Big Green Woods. All the little
woods creatures said they surely hoped
that plan of Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s, whatever
it was, would get rid of Tom Wildcat,
for they both feared and hated him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FOOLING TOM WILDCAT</h2></div>


<p>Now it so happened that Jack Rabbit
came over for an early breakfast of tender
blue grass, and he met Doctor Rabbit
just at the edge of the woods. Doctor
Rabbit was certainly glad of this, because
it was pretty dangerous for him
to go far out on the Wide Prairie.</p>

<p>Of course Jack Rabbit was very much
alarmed when Doctor Rabbit told him
Tom Wildcat had planned to eat him.</p>

<p>&#8220;My goodness!&#8221; was all poor Jack
Rabbit could say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen!&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve a little scheme.&#8221; And then to
make very sure that no one else heard,
he went up close to Jack Rabbit and
whispered in his ear for a time. Then
they both laughed and danced a jig.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>&#8220;Doctor Rabbit, you&#8217;re surely the
smartest rabbit that ever was!&#8221; Jack
Rabbit complimented his good friend.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit said they would have
to hurry now, and they went straight to
the big sycamore tree where Jack Rabbit
generally lay down to sun himself.</p>

<p>There was a deep, wide hole under this
tree, that Farmer Roe&#8217;s boy had dug for
a playhouse a good while ago. Doctor
Rabbit and his friend Jack Rabbit began
gathering long, slim, dead sticks and
laying them across this hole. All the
time they kept laughing to themselves.
The sticks were pretty rotten, and when
they had a whole lot of them laid across
the hole they covered them all over
with dead leaves and grass. When they
had finished, it looked as if there never
had been any hole at all.</p>

<p>They then went to several rabbit nests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
Jack Rabbit knew about, and got a lot
of rabbit fur. They took this fur and
made it into a good-sized, long body.
This done, they went up near Farmer
Roe&#8217;s house and got a pair of jack rabbit&#8217;s
ears that the farmer&#8217;s boy had thrown
away. They belonged to a rabbit that
had been unfortunate. They brought
these ears down to the big tree and fixed
them on the fur body they had made.
Then Doctor Rabbit&mdash;because he was
lighter than big Jack Rabbit&mdash;walked
very, very carefully out on the leaves
and sticks over the hole and laid down
that make-believe jack rabbit.</p>

<p>Well, sir, you would have been surprised
to see how much that <i>did</i> look like
the real Jack Rabbit lying there. Doctor
Rabbit said he really had to look at Jack
Rabbit to make sure it wasn&#8217;t he. Then
they both laughed a great deal, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
were so glad they had thought of this
plan. But it was getting close to noon,
and they hurried away and hid in a briar
patch, where they could watch.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit and his friend Jack
did not have to wait long. Suddenly
Doctor Rabbit poked Jack Rabbit and
told him to keep very still. They both
looked. There was Tom Wildcat, creeping
through the woods. He was coming
very, very cautiously and looking straight
toward the tree where Jack Rabbit took
his nap. When he got a little closer he
crouched down almost flat to the ground.
He jerked his tail from side to side and
began creeping up more cautiously than
ever, because he thought he saw Jack
Rabbit lying there sound asleep.</p>

<p>Well, it surely was funny to see how
badly slinky Tom was being fooled, and
Doctor Rabbit and cheery Jack Rabbit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
could scarcely keep from laughing; but
of course they didn&#8217;t dare make a sound.
Tom Wildcat would creep and crawl and
stop and watch, then creep and crawl
and stop and watch again, until finally
he got right behind the tree. Then he
crawled up the tree ever so carefully,
from behind. Presently he was up to
the long limb. Here he stopped and
looked down and grinned, and looked as
pleased as could be, and then he went
crawling out on that limb, slowly and
cautiously, until he was right over what
he thought was Jack Rabbit.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TOM WILDCAT HAS AN
ACCIDENT</h2></div>


<p>When Tom Wildcat had crawled out
on the limb and got to the place from
which he thought it would be best to
jump, he stood up and grinned ever so
broadly at what he considered his good
fortune. Then down he jumped, and
crash! he went right through those rotten
sticks and into that deep hole!</p>

<p>Then Doctor Rabbit and Jack Rabbit
ran out of the briar patch, and shouted
and laughed and laughed. By and by
Doctor Rabbit crept up to the hole and
looked down on Tom Wildcat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, how do you do, Friend Tom?
You must be digging a well to-day!&#8221;
Doctor Rabbit said, as if he meant it.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i039.jpg" alt="Crash! he went right through into that deep hole" /></div>
<p class="caption">Crash! he went right through
... into that deep hole!</p>

<p>Then Jack Rabbit came up to the hole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and looked down, and said, &#8220;Well, well,
our friend, Tom Wildcat! This is a
pleasant day, isn&#8217;t it, Tom? You seem
to be making a dinner of rabbit fur; I
notice you have a good deal down there!&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom ground his sharp teeth in anger
and glared up at Doctor Rabbit and Jack
Rabbit. Then suddenly he thought that
if he acted pleasant, he might deceive
them, and get out. He smiled up as
politely as anybody, and said, &#8220;Oh, I can
get out easily, if I want to, but I&#8217;ll always
be the best of friends with you if you
will just drop down that small log that
I noticed up there by the tree. The fact
is, I rather enjoy the joke; but now that
we&#8217;ve had a good time, I know you
won&#8217;t mind slipping that log down end
first. Then we can fix this hole up again,
and play a good joke on some of our
other friends.&#8221; And Tom Wildcat smiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and looked so pleasant that it seemed as
if he were as kind and good as anybody.</p>

<p>But Doctor Rabbit and Jack Rabbit
just chuckled to themselves, and Doctor
Rabbit said, &#8220;Oh, we won&#8217;t trouble ourselves
with getting you the log, Smarty
Wildcat. You can get out easily, if you
<i>want</i> to!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then Doctor Rabbit and jolly Jack
Rabbit both laughed right out loud,
and Jack Rabbit said cheerfully, &#8220;No,
Tom, we won&#8217;t bother about that log,
because you can get out so easily if you
<i>want</i> to!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, of course he can!&#8221; laughed Doctor
Rabbit. &#8220;Well, I hope you enjoy
your juicy dinner of rabbit fur, Tom.
You have a lot of it down there. Ha, ha,
ha! Good day, Thomas!&#8221; And away
went Doctor Rabbit and his friend Jack
Rabbit to tell all their little woods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
neighbors about getting Tom Wildcat
into a deep hole where he could not get
out.</p>

<p>In a short time everyone knew what
had happened, and that afternoon Tom
Wildcat found out what all the little
creatures of the Big Green Woods thought
of him. When Blue Jay and Jenny Jay
heard of it, they flew straight to the limb
over Tom&#8217;s head and scolded him to
their hearts&#8217; content. &#8220;He&#8217;s a thief and
a robber. He ate my eggs, and I hate
him! I&#8217;ll peck his eyes out!&#8221; Jenny Jay
shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate him, too!&#8221; Chatty Red Squirrel
barked out angrily from a limb overhead.
&#8220;He&#8217;s as mean as he can be! I hate
him! I hate him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Cheepy Chipmunk frisked up to the
hole and away again, because he was
afraid even to look at Tom Wildcat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
But all the time he was frisking back and
forth, saucy Cheepy scolded as hard as
he could. Stubby Woodchuck sat on a
near-by stump and poured forth his
scorn for Tom Wildcat. Jim Crow and
Robin-the-Red threatened from the tree
where they were perched, and all afternoon
the little creatures of the Big Green
Woods nagged old Tom and told him
he was the ugliest and meanest person
that ever lived.</p>

<p>After a while there were so many little
creatures around the hole and in the
tree over it, all scolding at the same time,
that Tom Wildcat was about deafened
with the noise. He put his paws over
his ears and ground his teeth in rage.
Now and then Stubby Woodchuck slipped
up to the hole and pushed a clod in on
Tom&#8217;s head, and then everyone shouted
for joy. But once or twice Tom Wildcat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
jumped so high he nearly jumped out,
and that scared everyone dreadfully.</p>

<p>After he sprang as high as he could
and found he could not get out, he sat
down in that hole and just growled and
growled. The little creatures thought
they had better be going then. For,
even if Tom Wildcat <i>was</i> down in that
hole, he <i>might</i> get out. And his growls!
They were terrible; so they all scampered
away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />





<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">A BIG SURPRISE</h2></div>


<p>All the little creatures surely were glad
that Tom Wildcat had fallen down into
the deep hole. They held a big meeting
that night in Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s front
yard, and talked the matter over. While
they talked, however, Doctor Rabbit
sent Jack Rabbit to a place near the hole,
&#8220;because,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said to his
friends, &#8220;old Thomas is mighty cunning,
and he might manage somehow to get
out. And if he <i>should</i> happen to scramble
out&mdash;well, he&#8217;d be pretty angry, and
pretty hungry, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed he would!&#8221; gasped Stubby
Woodchuck in a frightened whisper. &#8220;I
believe I&#8217;ll go home this very minute!&#8221;
And he did, as fast as his short legs would
carry him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s about time I was in bed,&#8221;
Cheepy Chipmunk said, and away he
scampered to his stump.</p>

<p>That broke up the meeting, and every
one of them hurried to his home. Pretty
soon Jack Rabbit came hopping back to
report to Doctor Rabbit. &#8220;He&#8217;s still
in the hole,&#8221; Jack Rabbit said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
think he can get out. I have a long way
to go before I reach home, and I guess
I&#8217;d better be going. I told Mrs. Jack
Rabbit I wouldn&#8217;t be out late. I&#8217;ll see
you in the morning, Doctor.&#8221; And with
that Jack Rabbit started off on a run,
and went like a streak through the woods
toward the Wide Prairie.</p>

<p>The next morning, a little after daylight,
Doctor Rabbit was awakened by
the loud, harsh cries of Blue Jay, just
outside the upstairs window.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit hurried out.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>&#8220;He&#8217;s out and he&#8217;s gone!&#8221; Blue Jay
shouted. &#8220;Tom Wildcat is out of that
hole! I just came from there this
minute!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is?&#8221; Doctor Rabbit exclaimed
in a frightened voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, he is!&#8221; Blue Jay replied,
all in a flutter of excitement.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit scratched his head in
wonder. &#8220;I was just a little afraid of
that,&#8221; he said half to himself, &#8220;because
old Tom is certainly cunning; but I
wonder how he got out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Blue Jay, &#8220;I looked into
that hole pretty close, and I saw just
how he managed it. He dug two holes
in one side, where there were some small
roots. Then he dug two more holes a
little higher up. And then he dug two
more a little higher up, and then he
crawled up a little and dug two <i>more</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
holes, and so on till he got to the top.
There was a good deal of loose dirt in
the hole, and I&#8217;ve an idea that Tom
must have fallen back quite a number
of times before he finally reached the top.
He must have had a mighty hard time
of it. As like as not he had to work
most of the night.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TOM WILDCAT INVITES
DOCTOR RABBIT TO DINNER</h2></div>


<p>While Doctor Rabbit and busy Blue
Jay were talking, Doctor Rabbit said
suddenly, &#8220;Sh! keep still; there he is
now!&#8221; And sure enough, there was
Tom Wildcat just a little way off near a
stump, where he had pounced upon an
unfortunate mouse that happened to be
passing that way, and gobbled him up.</p>

<p>Tom Wildcat did not know there was
anyone around, so he smacked his lips
and smiled very broadly. It was only
a small breakfast&mdash;in fact, just about
enough for dessert for greedy Tom, but
he never was particular; he would just
as soon eat his dessert first as not. Indeed,
I think he&#8217;d a little rather.</p>

<p>And now Tom came slipping along and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
looking for some signs of Doctor Rabbit.
Then he happened to glance up and saw
Doctor Rabbit looking from the upstairs
window.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, good morning, Doctor Rabbit!&#8221;
he said in his most pleasing, company
voice, just as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning to you, Tom.&#8221; Doctor
Rabbit said it as pleasantly as if he
and Tom were the best of friends.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a fine morning,&#8221; wily Tom said,
looking up and smiling; but all the while
he was chuckling inwardly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful morning, just splendid.
And I never saw you looking so
fine,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said.</p>

<p>Well, sir, Tom Wildcat was actually
deceived when Doctor Rabbit told him
he looked so fine. He is such a vain
fellow he believes anybody who tells
him he is good-looking. That&#8217;s one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
thing Tom Wildcat will always believe,
because he <i>wants</i> to believe it.</p>

<p>But he was not one bit deceived about
anything else, for he remembered his
recent experience in the hole.</p>

<p>Because old Tom is always trying to
deceive others, naturally he sometimes
deceives himself. He thought that by
acting kind and polite to Doctor Rabbit
he might fool him, and so get him for
dinner. And it made his mouth water
to look at Doctor Rabbit and think what
a fine dinner he would make.</p>

<p>So he said gaily, &#8220;Well, we&#8217;ve had
quite a good deal of fun lately; and ha,
ha, ha! I&#8217;ve enjoyed it as much as
anyone. In fact, I really like jokes, and
I like you now better than ever, Doctor
Rabbit. You&#8217;re the smartest and most
sociable person in the woods. Do come
over to my house and take dinner with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
me. I&#8217;m going to have the loveliest
green peas, and beans, and lettuce, and
ever so many more of the sweetest vegetables
you ever tasted!&#8221;</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">O. POSSUM GETS SICK</h2></div>


<p>When Tom Wildcat smiled and spoke
about having all those nice vegetables
for dinner, Doctor Rabbit knew well
enough that he didn&#8217;t ever eat any such
things. No, sir; all Tom Wildcat wanted
was Doctor Rabbit. But Doctor Rabbit
was just as cunning as was Tom, so he
said, &#8220;It&#8217;s very kind of you to invite
me over to dinner, Friend Tom, very
kind, I am sure; but the fact is, I won&#8217;t
have time. I really am too busy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A good deal of sickness in the Woods,
I suppose,&#8221; Tom Wildcat said, as pleasantly
as could be.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, quite a good deal,&#8221; said Doctor
Rabbit; &#8220;especially a good many accidents,
lately.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Wildcat was so angry for a minute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
that he almost forgot to smile. He knew
what Doctor Rabbit meant by <i>accidents</i>.
He meant Tom&#8217;s getting his foot bitten
by Farmer Roe&#8217;s big dog, and his falling
into that hole. But by very hard work,
crafty Tom did manage to keep on smiling
as he said, &#8220;Well, I shall have to be going
on, then. Possibly you can come over
some other time and take dinner with
me. Good morning, Doctor Rabbit!&#8221;
And Tom Wildcat trotted off.</p>

<p>When he had disappeared, Doctor
Rabbit sat down in his big chair and
laughed and laughed. It would have
made anybody laugh to see how hard it
had been for Tom Wildcat to smile when
Doctor Rabbit spoke about so many
<i>accidents</i> lately.</p>

<p>There was a great deal of excitement
among the little creatures of the Big
Green Woods now. It was bad enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
to know that Tom Wildcat had come over
from his hollow tree near the Deep River,
but it was worse still to think that he
had fallen into that hole and climbed
out again.</p>

<p>Of course, they all had to go right on
eating, because nobody can live without
eating. And there was where the little
creatures were in great danger. They
were generally hunting something to eat,
and there was always someone like Tom
Wildcat watching for them, ready to
pounce upon them.</p>

<p>The next day Doctor Rabbit was called
to see O. Possum, who was sick. Mandy
Possum came over in a great hurry and
said O. Possum was having a severe pain
in his stomach. Doctor Rabbit got his
medicine case and went over to the
Possums&#8217; house with Mandy Possum as
fast as he could.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>Mandy said they would go in the
nearest way, which was through the
kitchen. She asked Doctor Rabbit to
excuse her kitchen, as she had not had
time to clean it up. Then as they went
through the parlor, she told him to excuse
that too, as she hadn&#8217;t had time to
clean that up. As they passed through
two other rooms, she said to excuse them;
she knew they were pretty dirty, but she
had not had time to clean them up. But
Doctor Rabbit didn&#8217;t say anything,
because no matter what time of day he
came to Mandy Possum&#8217;s house, she
always asked him to excuse the dirt, and
always said she hadn&#8217;t had time to clean
it up. Man doctors sometimes find it
that way, too.</p>

<p>Well, they finally came to O. Possum,
who was off in a corner bedroom. He
lay in bed with some turpentine and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
hot stove lid on his stomach. He began
to groan terribly when Doctor Rabbit
came in. &#8220;Oh my, oh my,&#8221; he groaned,
&#8220;I know I&#8217;m going to die! Yes, I can
feel it, and my wife wants me to die;
she&#8217;s got turpentine and a hot stove lid
on my stomach, and I&#8217;m roasting alive.
Oh dear! Oh dear!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTORING O. POSSUM AND

<p>As soon as he looked at O. Possum
Doctor Rabbit knew positively that he
was not seriously sick, for he had seen
him like that several times before. Doctor
Rabbit said, &#8220;Let me see your
tongue,&#8221; and O. Possum grunted and
put his tongue out. It was badly coated.
&#8220;I see!&#8221; said Doctor Rabbit, wisely.
Then he examined his patient by thumping
his chest and his stomach and his
back, and finally said, &#8220;Friend Possum,
what have you eaten lately?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I haven&#8217;t eaten anything to
speak of,&#8221; O. Possum groaned. &#8220;Only
a little piece of chicken.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was that all?&#8221; asked Doctor Rabbit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, maybe I did eat <i>two</i> little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
pieces,&#8221; O. Possum groaned again. &#8220;But
that was all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He ate a little pudding, too, Doctor,&#8221;
ventured Mandy Possum, timidly.</p>

<p>&#8220;How much?&#8221; Doctor Rabbit asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just the smallest bit,&#8221; O. Possum
began, but Doctor Rabbit interrupted
him with, &#8220;Exactly how much?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, not more than a small bowl full.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see! I see!&#8221; exclaimed Doctor
Rabbit, smiling, and his bright eyes
twinkled. &#8220;Your bowls all hold a quart,
Brother Possum. A bowl of pudding,
two big pieces of chicken, some pie and
some cake, and a plate of dumplings Mrs.
Possum had left over from yesterday!&#8221;
And Doctor Rabbit laughed, while
O. Possum looked very, very much
surprised, because that was exactly what
he <i>had</i> eaten, and he wondered how
Doctor Rabbit could tell.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i061.jpg" alt="Mr. Possum, what have you
eaten lately" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;Mr. Possum, what have you
eaten lately?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>&#8220;The fact is,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said,
&#8220;you have been making a pig of yourself,
and you have acute indigestion.
Here, Friend Possum; take this tablespoonful
of medicine.&#8221;</p>

<p>O. Possum swallowed the medicine,
and then coughed and choked, and said,
&#8220;Whew! that&#8217;s the nastiest tasting medicine
I ever swallowed. Mandy, my dear,
I&#8217;ll have to trouble you for a drink of
water.&#8221; After he had taken the water,
he said he felt a great deal better.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can feel that medicine taking right
hold,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Yes, sir, I can <i>feel</i> it,
and I certainly am better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit looked with a wise
glance over his glasses at Mandy Possum,
and said, &#8220;Give him a tablespoonful of
the medicine every hour until he has
taken <i>five</i> doses; and he must not eat a
thing for two whole days.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s pretty tough,&#8221; sighed
O. Possum. He was already thinking
about a big fat hen that Mandy Possum
was going to cook that very day. But
O. Possum said he realized he would have
to do what the doctor ordered, and that
ended it.</p>

<p>Just then there was a knock at the
door. Sophy Woodchuck was there to
say that Doctor Rabbit was wanted at
her house at once, for Stubby Woodchuck
was feeling pretty poorly.</p>

<p>Well, when Doctor Rabbit got over
to the Woodchucks&#8217; he found poor old
Stubby in bed, and groaning just about
the way O. Possum had been doing.
And presently Doctor Rabbit found out
Stubby&#8217;s trouble was about the same as
O. Possum&#8217;s. He had gorged himself
with too many nuts and other things he
liked, until <i>he</i> had acute indigestion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
In fact, Doctor Rabbit had found out
long before that most of the sickness
among the little creatures of the Big
Green Woods was due to the fact that
they <i>ate too much</i>.</p>

<p>So Stubby Woodchuck had to take a
bottle of terribly bitter medicine, and he
too had to go two whole days without
eating a bite. He said he felt better
after he had taken the first dose of medicine;
and Doctor Rabbit said that he
would have to be going. First, however,
he took three bottles of medicine from
his case, mixed them all together, and
put them in one bottle. When it was
mixed that way the medicine was terribly
bitter, and Doctor Rabbit chuckled all
the time. &#8220;I&#8217;m getting ready to throw
this medicine right into Tom Wildcat&#8217;s
mouth if he gets after me,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit
explained, and then he slipped out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
the door and went hoppity, hoppity, hoppity,
as fast as he could go, toward home.</p>

<p>Now and then as he ran, Doctor Rabbit
would stop and sit up and look and listen.
He knew that every minute he must be
watching out for Tom Wildcat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">STUBBY WOODCHUCK&#8217;S
EXCITING ADVENTURE</h2></div>


<p>In a few days O. Possum and Stubby
Woodchuck were around again as usual,
and one fine, bright morning Stubby
went out for something to eat. Before
he started, however, he got up on his
stump and looked in every direction.
He did not see anyone to be afraid of,
so he concluded the first thing he would
do would be to slip down to the Murmuring
Brook for a nice fresh drink.</p>

<p>As he went along he stopped every
now and then and looked back toward
his stump, but everything seemed to be
all right, and he went ahead. Then,
when he had gone some distance, his
heart suddenly seemed to come up in
his mouth, he was so frightened. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
was sure he heard a slight noise a little
way ahead, among some bushes; and
he was sure he saw a crouching form.</p>

<p>Well, poor Stubby was in a pretty
bad fix. He looked back at his stump.
Then he shivered; his stump was ever
so far away. He darted a swift glance
around to see if there wasn&#8217;t some hole
handy, that he could run into.</p>

<p>All he could see was a small hole at the
base of a tree a little way off. Stubby
didn&#8217;t know, of course, whether he could
squeeze into that hole or not, but he
decided he must run and try anyway.
Away he started, as fast as his legs would
go, and then he <i>was</i> frightened, for from
behind those bushes came Tom Wildcat!</p>

<p>Stubby Woodchuck managed to reach
the hole, but he was in a frenzy of fear.
Try as he would, he couldn&#8217;t squeeze
into that small opening. The very next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
second Tom Wildcat pounced on him.
Poor Stubby was so scared he could not
speak. First Tom held him between his
paws and glared at him. Then he picked
him up in his mouth and carried him
out into an open space and set him
down again. Stubby promptly started
to run away, but Tom Wildcat just put
his paw on him and pulled him back.</p>

<p>Old Tom did this exactly the way a
cat sometimes plays with a live mouse
before he gobbles him up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, young fellow,&#8221; Tom Wildcat
said, with a terrible grin, &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ve
got you at last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Stubby Woodchuck lay on his side and
panted and panted, he was so frightened;
but he was glad he was still alive, and he
thought he might still find some way of
escape. Then all of a sudden he <i>did</i>
think of something.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said very weakly, &#8220;you&#8217;ve
got me, Tom Wildcat; but I think when
you know you&#8217;re going to die a little
while after eating me, you&#8217;ll wish you
hadn&#8217;t caught me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha, ha!&#8221; Tom Wildcat laughed.
&#8220;Yes, I suppose I&#8217;ll die after eating you.
Ha, ha, ha! Woodchuck is one of my
favorite dishes. Ha, ha, ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; the clever Stubby said again,
very weakly, &#8220;if I were healthy, that
would be different, but I was poisoned a
little while ago, and I was just going
down for one last drink, so I could die in
comfort!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s that?&#8221; exclaimed Tom
Wildcat, jumping up with wide eyes
and walking round and round Stubby
Woodchuck. &#8220;How do you know you
are poisoned?&#8221; he asked sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; Stubby answered&mdash;and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
sounded as if he were about gone&mdash;&#8220;because
I was sick and Doctor Rabbit
gave me the wrong medicine. He feels
awfully bad about it, and said he could
not bear to see me die!&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TOM WILDCAT GETS
FRIGHTENED</h2></div>


<p>While Tom Wildcat walked round and
round Stubby Woodchuck, looking at
him and getting more and more scared
every minute, Stubby went right on
talking. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he said very weakly,
&#8220;Doctor Rabbit gave me the wrong kind
of pills. His calomel pills and his strychnine
pills all being white, he made a
mistake, and gave me strychnine; and he
did not find out until it was too late.
Oh, dear me! I can&#8217;t last long now.
The poison is paining me terribly. Do
eat me up quick, I beg of you! Eat me
up quick! Yes, I can feel the poison
working out through my skin; it is all
through me and all over me!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, sir, old Tom Wildcat had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
surprised many times in his life, but
this was the biggest surprise he had ever
had. And he suddenly remembered he
had had his mouth on Stubby Woodchuck.
All this time Stubby kept one
eye open just the smallest bit, so that
he could watch the wily Tom.</p>

<p>When Stubby Woodchuck spoke about
feeling the poison coming out on his
skin, Tom Wildcat&#8217;s eyes grew wide with
fear, and he began to spit and spit,
because he thought that Stubby <i>was</i>
poisoned. Tom began to imagine he
could taste something bitter in his own
mouth. That&#8217;s what happens sometimes
when people get to imagining things.
Tom Wildcat spit ever so many times to
make sure to get all the poison out of his
mouth.</p>

<p>After a while he said pretty low, and
to himself, although sharp-eared Stubby<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
heard, &#8220;My goodness! I believe I do
feel a little queer myself! Sakes alive!
I wonder if I <i>am</i> poisoned! Dear me!
I wonder what I ought to do if I am!
Maybe if I run around real fast, and get
warmed up, that will help me. Anyway
I&#8217;ll try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>And away Tom Wildcat ran, round and
round in a big circle. But he did not go
far off, so Stubby just had to lie quite
still.</p>

<p>At last Tom stopped. &#8220;Maybe climbing
a tree would help me,&#8221; he said, and
away he went for a tree, then up into the
tree; but he was right down again in no
time, so Stubby Woodchuck could not
move. Tom Wildcat was panting now,
ever so hard. He came up and stood
looking down at Stubby. Presently he
said, &#8220;Well, I believe I&#8217;m feeling a little
better, but I guess I&#8217;ll wait around here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
a while and see if I get to feeling queer
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tom Wildcat then lay down, with his
head between his paws, and was quite
still for a long time.</p>

<p>After a while he stretched and yawned,
and said, &#8220;Ho, hum,&#8221; and rubbed his
eyes. Now the very minute old Tom
rubbed his eyes, he didn&#8217;t have to
<i>imagine</i> something hurt him; he <i>knew</i> it
did&mdash;and I&#8217;ll tell you what it was.
You remember that hot salve that Doctor
Rabbit put on the foot the dog had
bitten? Well, that hot salve keeps its
strength for days and days, and when
Tom Wildcat, not thinking, rubbed his
eyes, he rubbed some of that hot salve
right into one of them. It was in only
<i>one</i> eye, but my! how that eye did burn!
One eye was certainly enough. Tom
Wildcat let out a yell that could be heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
all over the Big Green Woods; and then
before he thought, he rubbed his eye
again, and of course he rubbed in some
more hot salve.</p>

<p>Well, it got to smarting and burning
so badly that it nearly set Tom Wildcat
crazy. With both eyes shut, and yowling
terribly, he began running in every direction.
The first thing he ran into was a
brush thicket; then he backed out of that
and started again, and presently butted
his head against a tree.</p>

<p>By this time he had forgotten all about
Stubby and everything else except that
smarting and burning in his eye.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">TOM WILDCAT MAKES A
DISCOVERY</h2></div>


<p>When Tom Wildcat began running
around with his smarting eye, Stubby
looked up mighty quick to see whether
there was any chance of his running
away. You see, he had to be very, very
careful now about trying to get away,
because he probably would be safe if he
lay there long enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;And still,&#8221; Stubby said to himself,
&#8220;Tom Wildcat might fool around and
watch me, and just keep on watching
me, to see if I die; and then when he sees
I <i>don&#8217;t</i> die, he might grow suspicious.
And still,&#8221; he went on thinking, &#8220;if I
should start to run, and old Tom should
see me, then he <i>would</i> know I&#8217;m not
poisoned, and he&#8217;d finish me sure!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>So you see it was pretty hard for
Stubby Woodchuck to decide what to
do. Of course, if he could have been sure
he could get back to his home in the
stump, he would have jumped up and
gone in no time. However, after he had
watched the queer actions of Tom Wildcat
for a while, Stubby began to be a
little bolder. He thought Tom Wildcat
had surely gone crazy this time. Of
course he knew about the hot salve on
Tom&#8217;s sore foot, but he had forgotten all
about it; and even if he had remembered,
he probably would not have thought <i>that</i>
was what made the old villain tear
around so.</p>

<p>Stubby Woodchuck was afraid, too,
that since Tom Wildcat was acting so
crazy, he might suddenly decide to make
a meal even on a <i>poisoned</i> woodchuck.
The more Stubby Woodchuck thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
of this, the more frightened he was; and
the next time Tom Wildcat ran into a
thicket, and squawked, and began holding
his paws over his eyes, Stubby
bravely stood up. Then all of a sudden,
right close by, Doctor Rabbit shouted,
&#8220;Run, Brother Woodchuck! Run! run!&#8221;
And away went clumsy Stubby toward
his stump. He thought he was done
for once, when Tom Wildcat came in
that direction; but Tom Wildcat did
not see Stubby at all, and he got safely
to his stump.</p>

<p>He ran in and fell down on the floor,
panting so he could not speak. Sophy
Woodchuck hurried around and brought
out the camphor bottle. After Stubby
Woodchuck had smelled the camphor a
little, he was able to sit up in a chair and
tell his wife what had happened.</p>

<p>Just as Stubby finished his strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
story, Doctor Rabbit burst in, and how
he did laugh about Tom Wildcat&#8217;s tearing
around so! And Doctor Rabbit was so
glad, too, that his friend Stubby had
escaped.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit said, &#8220;I was out in my
front yard when I heard those terrible
yowls of Tom Wildcat&#8217;s, and I hurried
over to see what the trouble was. When
I saw old T. Wildcat rubbing his eye with
his sore foot, I knew right away it was
that hot salve. And as soon as I saw
my friend Stubby, I guessed what had
<i>almost</i> happened to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What became of Tom Wildcat?&#8221;
asked Stubby Woodchuck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, sir,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said, &#8220;he
finally ran over the bank and fell into the
Murmuring Brook, head over heels. He
crawled out as wet as any rat you ever
saw. But I think the water helped his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
eye, for he didn&#8217;t rub it any more&mdash;just
looked around as if he felt terribly
ashamed, and hoped no one saw him.
And then he slipped over to where you
had been, Friend Stubby, and you should
have seen and heard him! &#8216;Gone!&#8217; he
said. &#8216;And he&#8217;s made a fool of me. He
wasn&#8217;t poisoned at all! But just wait
until the <i>next</i> time, Stub Woodchuck!
And that old fat Doctor Rabbit who
helped him get away&mdash;I&#8217;ll attend to
him. <i>Indeed</i> I will.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; added Doctor Rabbit, &#8220;I
knew I could get home as easy as anything,
because I had a good start; so I
yelled out and said, &#8216;Ha! ha! ha! Tom
Wildcat, I guess we can&#8217;t fool you!
Ha! ha! ha! Oh, no, not at all! Ha!
ha! ha! Good day, Mr. T. Wildcat!&#8217;
Then I ran home so fast I know he
didn&#8217;t get more, than a glimpse of me.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DOCTOR RABBIT THINKS OF
A NEW SCHEME</h2></div>


<p>Sophy Woodchuck was very, very glad
that her Stubby had come through his
terrible adventure safely, but she said
she would be troubled now as long as
Tom Wildcat was around. &#8220;I certainly
do wish we could think of some plan to
get rid of him&#8221;, she said, and Doctor
Rabbit chuckled.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i083.jpg" alt="I have a plan, Mrs. Woodchuck" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;I have a plan, Mrs. Woodchuck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a plan, Mrs. Woodchuck,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;It came to me only this morning,
so you must give me a few days to get
everything ready. And don&#8217;t you worry
any more about Tom Wildcat being
around. No, sir! Don&#8217;t you worry a
bit! I&#8217;ve got an idea, and pretty soon
old Tom will go tearing out of these
woods, and he&#8217;ll <i>stay</i> out! Indeed he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
will! Ha, ha, ha!&#8221; And Doctor Rabbit
laughed until his fat sides shook.</p>



<p>This made the Woodchuck family feel
pretty fine, and it made them curious,
too. They knew that Doctor Rabbit was
very wise in a good many things, and
especially wise in planning ways to get
rid of a very bad enemy. They remembered
how he had got rid of troublesome
Ki-yi Coyote. Of course Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s
plan of getting rid of Tom Wildcat
in that hole had failed; but we must
admit it was a good scheme, anyway.</p>

<p>Well, of course the Woodchucks wanted
to know right away what Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s
new scheme was, but he only chuckled,
and said he would have to be going now
to get things ready. &#8220;I&#8217;ll need you and
all our other friends and neighbors to
help me,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit said. &#8220;None
of you will have to do very much, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
what you do, you must do exactly right.
Now I am going to slip around among
our friends and get them to promise to
be ready at any time, and to do just
what I tell them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You certainly can count on us!&#8221;
exclaimed Stubby and Sophy, in the
same breath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sure of that,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit
replied, and then bidding them a very
good morning, he went swiftly away,
hoppity, hoppity, to tell all the others.</p>

<p>In a short time all the little creatures
of the Big Green Woods knew that Doctor
Rabbit was working on a new scheme
to get rid of Tom Wildcat. For several
days Doctor Rabbit was mysteriously
engaged in some kind of work at his
house. He did not go out at all, except
to Farmer Roe&#8217;s garden once or twice a
day, to get some green peas to eat. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
Doctor Rabbit would not say a word to
anyone. He was surely busy.</p>

<p>Blue Jay and Jim Crow, and several
others, came to Doctor Rabbit when he
was in the pea patch one morning and
wanted him to tell them what the scheme
was; but he only laughed, and said he
would have to be going right home,
because he was so busy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty soon I&#8217;ll be ready, and then
I&#8217;ll tell you about it,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit
said as he hurried away.</p>

<p>Finally, after a day or two, Blue Jay
became so curious he could not wait any
longer. So he hid in a tree near Doctor
Rabbit&#8217;s house and watched. Perhaps
Blue Jay ought not to have done this,
but it seemed as if he just <i>couldn&#8217;t</i> wait.
He hid in the tree and watched all day,
but he did not see anything until along
toward evening. Then he saw Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Rabbit open his kitchen door. He had
in his hand a bucket of paint and a paint
brush. But that was all that Blue Jay
saw, for Doctor Rabbit wiped the sweat
off his face and went back into the
house, shutting the door behind him.</p>

<p>Well, that was a little news anyway,
and busy Blue Jay slipped around and
told what he had seen. Then all of
the little creatures <i>were</i> curious. They
couldn&#8217;t imagine what Doctor Rabbit
was doing with that paint. Cheepy
Chipmunk said perhaps Doctor Rabbit
was going to paint himself all up terribly
black, and scare Tom Wildcat away.
But the others said this could not be so,
because Doctor Rabbit had had plenty
of time to paint <i>himself</i>, if that was what
he intended. &#8220;No,&#8221; Blue Jay said,
scratching his head, &#8220;that&#8217;s not it. I
can&#8217;t figure out what he&#8217;s doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Next day, while all the little creatures
of the Big Green Woods were wondering
just what Doctor Rabbit could be doing,
Chatty Red Squirrel had an exciting
time. It was a beautiful morning. The
sun shone bright, and everything in the
woods smelled so fresh and sweet that it
was very fine to be out.</p>

<p>Chatty Red Squirrel was out, jumping
about on the limbs of his tree and enjoying
himself generally. He would frisk
about first on one big limb, then on another,
and every now and then he would
bark a little. This was his way of
laughing sometimes when he was as glad
to be alive as he was this morning.</p>

<p>Pretty soon Chatty Squirrel scrambled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
down his tree and went frisking around
on the ground. Sometimes he would
pick up an old worm-eaten nut and bite
into it, and laugh, and throw it away.
Then he would frisk around again, so
fast that it would almost make anyone
dizzy to look at him. And as sure
as anything, some one <i>was</i> watching
Chatty Squirrel, and watching him very
closely, too. Not far away&mdash;just behind
the nearest dogwood thicket, in fact&mdash;Tom
Wildcat lay hiding and watching
every movement that Chatty made.
Old Tom was very hungry, and he believed
here was a fine chance for a
breakfast.</p>

<p>Now when Tom Wildcat hides in the
woods, he can lie so still that unless you
happen to look right at him you would
never know he was there. And he can
lie still so long you would think he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
couldn&#8217;t stand it; but somehow he can,
for that&#8217;s his nature.</p>

<p>Tom Wildcat lay behind that thicket
and watched for nearly an hour while
Chatty Squirrel played around and had
a fine time&mdash;never thinking, of course,
that Tom Wildcat was anywhere near.</p>

<p>Then at last Chatty started straight
toward the thicket where Tom Wildcat
lay. Tom crouched down close to the
ground and got all ready to spring. He
thought now surely he would get a breakfast.
But after all he was the one who
was the most surprised, for a little way
off he heard some one cry out, &#8220;Run for
your tree, Friend Chatty. Here&#8217;s Tom
Wildcat!&#8221;</p>

<p>It was Doctor Rabbit who had shouted.
He just happened to be passing that
way to get a drink at the Murmuring
Brook, and he couldn&#8217;t bear to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
Chatty Red Squirrel get caught, just
when he was having such a good time.</p>

<p>My! how frightened little Chatty was,
and how he did run for his tree! As he
went up the trunk Tom Wildcat sprang
after him; but Chatty Red got away,
and ran into his hole, high up in the
tree. Tom Wildcat could not squeeze
in there, he knew, so he didn&#8217;t try. He
was terribly angry, and, seeing Doctor
Rabbit, who had stopped to see if Chatty
Squirrel had escaped, started for him
with a wild bound. Well, sir, Tom
Wildcat ran so fast that before Doctor
Rabbit could get away he felt a little of
his tail pulled out. Then for a time
there was an exciting race. It seemed as
if Tom Wildcat ran twice as fast as usual,
and Doctor Rabbit was kept dodging
so often he couldn&#8217;t get a start. But
presently, when Doctor Rabbit made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
sudden jump to one side, Tom couldn&#8217;t
quite stop in time, and he butted his
head square against a tree.</p>

<p>Tom Wildcat yelled and started out
after Doctor Rabbit harder than ever,
and Chatty Squirrel, who was watching
from his hole in the tree, laughed right
out when he heard that loud yell.</p>

<p>Doctor Rabbit had a good start now,
and, reaching his back door, he darted
in, shut the door, and locked it. &#8220;My!&#8221;
he exclaimed, when he was safe inside,
&#8220;that certainly was a narrow escape for
me! But I&#8217;m glad I happened along
that way. If I hadn&#8217;t, Chatty Squirrel
would have been caught sure enough.
I&#8217;ll attend to T. Wildcat!&#8221; And Doctor
Rabbit began laughing to himself again.
&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I certainly will
attend to him, and that before very
long, too. Ha! ha! ha!&#8221; Doctor Rabbit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
laughed and laughed every time he
thought about the fine new scheme he
was going to use just as soon as he could
get ready. Once Doctor Rabbit thought
he would tell one or two of his friends so
they could help him with his plan. But
at last he decided it would be best for
him to do it all himself. Then it would
not be possible for Tom Wildcat to find
out the least thing about Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s
secret.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">O. POSSUM&#8217;S FUNNY
MISTAKE</h2></div>


<p>After Stubby Woodchuck had nearly
lost his life, and after Chatty Red Squirrel
had nearly lost <i>his</i> life, all the little
creatures of the Big Green Woods were
greatly excited. When things like this
happen to them, they talk about nothing
else for a time.</p>

<p>When they went out of their homes
every morning for something to eat, they
were in constant fear of Tom Wildcat.
One day Cheepy Chipmunk said he was
not getting more than half enough food,
because he had to spend most of his
time watching out. Blue Jay said it was
the same in his case. He said that
every time he started to pull a worm
out of the ground he had to stop several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
times and look around. And sometimes,
he said, the worm would crawl back into
the ground before he could get it.</p>

<p>Once, Blue Jay said, when he was
pulling a big worm from the ground for
Jenny Jay, he thought he heard a noise
behind him, and he stopped and looked
around. When he turned back again,
Robin-the-Red had pulled the worm out
and gone away with it. After gobbling
the worm, Robin came back and explained
that he had been having so
much bad luck in getting worms himself
lately that he was about starved.</p>

<p>Blue Jay had accepted the apology,
but he didn&#8217;t feel very good even at that.
He said, &#8220;All right for this time, Mr.
Robin, but hereafter I&#8217;ll thank you to
let my worms alone.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think we
can blame Blue Jay for being a little
cross with Robin-the-Red; but they both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
understood, because when Blue Jay got
a chance, he did the very same thing
with Robin.</p>

<p>Then O. Possum had a little trouble,
too. One morning he came running in at
the door of his stump and laid something
down before Mandy Possum. &#8220;Well!&#8221;
shouted O. Possum, &#8220;here&#8217;s a nice fat
chicken for you, Mandy Possum! I guess
we won&#8217;t starve if Tom Wildcat <i>is</i> prowling
around.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mandy Possum went up to the chicken
and turned it over. Well, sir, it proved
to be nothing but an old dried-up head
and a pair of chicken wings that had
been lying in the farmer&#8217;s garden about
a year.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; exclaimed Mandy Possum,
in great disgust. &#8220;Humph, you call that
a big fat hen, do you, Mr. Possum?
You grabbed it so quick and ran so fast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
you <i>thought</i> it was a big fat hen. Ha, ha,
ha!&#8221; Mandy Possum laughed. &#8220;Tom
Wildcat has certainly got on your nerves.
Ha, ha, ha!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then O. Possum looked and saw the
mistake he had made. &#8220;Huh!&#8221; was all
he could say, he was so ashamed. And
as he slipped out of doors he mumbled
to himself, &#8220;I&#8217;ll get a live one.&#8221; Then,
after he had sat out in the sun for a little
while he began laughing all to himself.
&#8220;That <i>was</i> a pretty good joke on me! It
surely was,&#8221; O. Possum said, and he
found himself enjoying the joke about as
much as Mandy Possum had done.</p>

<p>Well, the next morning Doctor Rabbit
slipped around pretty early and told his
friends he was ready with his scheme.
He carried a big bundle of signs, all
painted with the finest black letters, and
he tacked up a sign on the front door of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the home of each of his friends and
neighbors. The little creatures were all
surprised, and how they did admire
Doctor Rabbit for his cleverness! They
said that no one in the world but Doctor
Rabbit could have thought of such a fine
scheme, and they were very sure that
Tom Wildcat would soon receive the
surprise of his life.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TOM WILDCAT DECIDES TO
MAKE A VISIT</h2></div>


<p>When Doctor Rabbit had all his signs
tacked up on the front doors, the homes
of the little creatures of the Big Green
Woods certainly presented a funny sight.
That is, it was funny to Doctor Rabbit
and his friends, but it would not be funny
to Tom Wildcat when he saw those signs;
I should say not! And now Doctor
Rabbit was all ready for Tom Wildcat
to come over from his home in the hollow
tree near the Deep River.</p>

<p>For several mornings old Tom had
come over to the Big Green Woods pretty
early; but after he had had such bad luck
in letting Stubby Woodchuck and Chatty
Squirrel get away, he decided not to
come for a time. He thought perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
they would forget about him, and then
he could slip in suddenly and surprise
them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile he was fortunate in pouncing
upon a foolish young chicken that
had strayed from the farmer&#8217;s barnyard
and gone too near the Deep River.</p>

<p>The next morning Tom Wildcat was
fortunate again. A big, fat woodrat,
that had been over to Farmer Roe&#8217;s
feasting on a very young chicken, was
hurrying back home when he ran too
close to the tree where Tom Wildcat
lived. You may be sure Tom gobbled
up that woodrat in a hurry.</p>

<p>Afterward he smacked his lips and
said, &#8220;That reminds me that I haven&#8217;t
been over to the Big Green Woods for
several days. Probably by this time
those people over there have forgotten
all about me. I&#8217;ll just pay them a visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
this very day. What I really need now
is rabbit, and blue jay, and woodchuck,
and things of that sort. One gets rather
tired of chicken and rat. Yes, I need a
change in diet, and I&#8217;ll just slip over and
pay my friends a visit. They have not
invited me, but I&#8217;ll slip over anyway,
just to be friendly,&#8221; and sly old Tom
smiled until he showed all of his very
sharp teeth. He was surely pleased at
the thought of stealing into the Big
Green Woods again. And his sore foot
was now entirely well.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TOM WILDCAT IS GREATLY
SURPRISED</h2></div>


<p>After Doctor Rabbit had tacked up the
signs, of course all the little creatures of
the Big Green Woods were on the lookout
for Tom Wildcat. They were sadly disappointed
when he did not come right
away. Stubby Woodchuck said he was
afraid Tom Wildcat had seen the signs
and gone away, and that they had missed
the fun of seeing him run; but Doctor
Rabbit said he was sure that Tom
had not been over since the signs were
tacked up. He said that Blue Jay and
Jenny Jay had taken turns and watched
constantly, and that they had not found
the least track of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;ll be over again; don&#8217;t you ever
think he will not,&#8221; Doctor Rabbit told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
his friends, and continued, &#8220;He&#8217;s just
taking his meals somewhere else to fool
us. Likely enough he&#8217;s been paying
some more visits to the farmer&#8217;s chicken
roosts; and about the time he thinks we
have forgotten all about him, he&#8217;ll be
over here. You just watch and see!&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, the very day that Tom Wildcat
said he believed he would go over to the
Big Green Woods, he <i>did</i> go. Yes, sir,
he went; and with his mouth just watering
for Stubby Woodchuck and several
others. It so happened that he did not
go the way he usually went. He thought
he would slip in by another way, and
surprise one or two of the little creatures.</p>

<p>In fact, he came slipping in the back
way, and so did not see any of the signs
on the front doors until he slipped around
in front of the Woodchucks&#8217; house.</p>

<p>Now as sly as Tom Wildcat had been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
he had not been sly enough for Blue Jay
and Jenny. They saw him coming; so
they flew around quickly and told Doctor
Rabbit and then all the other little
creatures.</p>

<p>Tom Wildcat read the sign on Stubby
Woodchuck&#8217;s door, and this is what it
said:</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Cat Cholera Here!<br />
Come In and Help!</span></p>

<p>Well, sir, you should have seen Tom&#8217;s
glarey eyes when he read that sign! They
almost popped out of his head, he was so
scared. And then, just a little distance
away, he read exactly the same thing on
the Chipmunks&#8217; door; and there was
Cheepy Chipmunk, just outside his door,
acting mighty queer. You see, Cheepy
Chipmunk had been watching, and now
he did exactly what Doctor Rabbit had
told him to do. Little Cheepy acted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
terribly sick, and leaning up against his
front door, where the sign was, he said
loud enough so that Tom Wildcat could
hear, &#8220;Oh, dear me; I&#8217;m so sick, and it&#8217;s
awful to have to die with this old cat
cholera! But anyway I hope Tom Wildcat
gets it and dies from it. But I suppose
he got it long ago, and is dead by
this time. Yes, I suppose it was he who
brought it over and gave it to us. Oh,
it&#8217;s terrible!&#8221; And then Cheepy sank
down to the ground and certainly looked
as if he were breathing his last. Just
then Mrs. Cheepy did what Doctor
Rabbit had told her to do. She came
staggering out of the house and fell down
right beside Mr. Cheepy on the ground.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, this cat cholera is awful, and we
are all going to die&mdash;I know we are!&#8221;
she groaned&mdash;and she acted as if she were
about gone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>Well, sir, when old Tom read those
signs, and when he heard what the
Cheepy Chipmunks said and saw how
they acted, he certainly was scared. I
should say he was scared! He was more
scared than he had ever been in his life.
You see, there is nothing in the whole
wide world that Tom Wildcat is so much
afraid of as cat cholera. He knew well
enough that if he got <i>that</i> disease he
wouldn&#8217;t last long. So it is no wonder
that he was scared.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TOM WILDCAT BECOMES
FRIGHTENED</h2></div>


<p>When Tom read those signs on Stubby
Woodchuck&#8217;s and Cheepy Chipmunk&#8217;s
doors, and when he saw how very sick
the Chipmunks acted, he started away
from there that very minute. His big
green eyes were very wide, and he kept
looking back toward Cheepy Chipmunk&#8217;s
house, so that he did not notice where
he was going, and the first thing he knew
he bumped right into O. Possum&#8217;s house.
And there on O. Possum&#8217;s door was a
big sign in black letters reading,</p>

<p class="center">
<span class="smcap">Cat Cholera Here!<br />
Come In and Help!</span></p>

<p>O. Possum&#8217;s door was closed, but poor
scared Tom heard a terrible groan inside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
You see, O. Possum had been looking
out of his window and had seen Tom
Wildcat coming. It was hard to groan
when he did so want to laugh.</p>

<p>Of course Tom jumped away from
O. Possum&#8217;s house in a hurry, and with
eyes wider than ever, started to get out
of the woods in another direction. He
kept looking back toward O. Possum&#8217;s
house, and pretty soon he ran against
Chatty Squirrel&#8217;s house, and there was
another of those terrible signs:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Cat Cholera Here!<br />
Come In and Help!</span></p>

<p>Well, Tom Wildcat jumped back about
scared stiff, and started off in another
direction. This time he ran. But again
he kept looking back at the signs and
forgot to look where he was going. The
first thing Tom Wildcat knew, he ran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
plump against Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s house;
and then he surely was more surprised
and frightened than ever. Because on
Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s front door was one of
those same terrible signs:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Cat Cholera Here!<br />
Come In and Help!</span></p>

<p>This was simply awful. &#8220;And so,&#8221;
Tom Wildcat said in a trembling voice,
&#8220;Doctor Rabbit has that dreadful disease
too, and not even all his medicine
can keep him from dying!&#8221; At the very
thought, he let out a most terrible yell,
and away he started out of those woods.
And this time he did not look back.
No, sir, he looked straight ahead; and
how he did run and yell, he was so
frightened!</p>

<p>The farther Tom Wildcat ran the more
frightened he became, and after a while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
he was going through those woods like
a streak. Yes, sir, Tom Wildcat was
terribly frightened; and he had his mind
made up that he knew mighty well what
he was going to do if he ever got out of
those woods alive!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">TOM WILDCAT MOVES HASTILY</h2></div>


<p>Kit Wildcat had just swept the upper
part of her house and was coming down
stairs, when she heard Tom Wildcat
tearing through the brush and yelling
like a madman.</p>

<p>Kit Wildcat ran out into the yard
and shouted, &#8220;Sakes alive, Tom Wildcat,
have you gone <i>plumb</i> crazy, or what in
the world is the matter with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>But Tom Wildcat didn&#8217;t stop; he came
right on and yelled as loud as he could.
&#8220;Crazy nothing! I&#8217;m not crazy, but
I&#8217;d rather be crazy than get cat cholera!
Come right this minute, Kit Wildcat,
this very minute! I&#8217;m going clear away
from this place, and never come within
ten miles of it again! Hurry, Kit!
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>&#8220;Who&#8217;s got it?&#8221; shrieked Kit Wildcat,
now very badly scared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody!&#8221; shouted Tom wildly.
&#8220;Cheepy Chipmunk, and Stubby Woodchuck,
and Doctor Rabbit himself has
it, and is dying with it this very minute!&#8221;
Then Tom Wildcat said, &#8220;I had gone
clear into those woods before I discovered
the trouble. On every door there&#8217;s a
cat cholera sign, asking anyone who
passes to come in and help; but I can tell
you, Kit Wildcat, I didn&#8217;t go in and
help. Why, I saw Cheepy Chipmunk
come out and fall down and die, and then
I saw his wife come out and die; and I
know everyone in the Big Green Woods
must be dead by this time, because you
know what cat cholera is. Come on,&#8221;
Tom Wildcat ended suddenly, &#8220;I&#8217;m
going!&#8221; and away he started, without
even waiting for Kit Wildcat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>&#8220;Wait until I get my coat!&#8221; Kit
shouted.</p>

<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t wait for anything!&#8221; old Tom
called back, and away he ran. Well,
Kit Wildcat was so scared she did not
try to get her coat, but just started off
right after Tom.</p>

<p>When Tom Wildcat started out of the
Big Green Woods yelling so loudly, all
the little creatures hurried out to watch
him. After a while they could not see
old Tom any more, although they could
hear him and Kit Wildcat yelling and
running away up the river. But busy
Blue Jay flew over the trees and watched.
And after a long time he came back and
said Tom and Kit Wildcat were still
running up the river, and that he had
heard them both say they knew of a
woods about twenty-five miles away,
and that they would go there and live.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>When Blue Jay delivered his message,
all the little creatures were gathered
together at Doctor Rabbit&#8217;s house. How
Doctor Rabbit did laugh! &#8220;I just knew
I could fool old Tom Wildcat; and if I
fooled Tom Wildcat, I knew we&#8217;d get
rid of Kit Wildcat, too. Ha! ha! ha!&#8221;
Then Doctor Rabbit said, &#8220;Do come in
now, my friends. I have a splendid
meal all ready for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the little creatures went in and ate
about all they could hold. It certainly
was fine to know that they could eat in
so much comfort, and that Tom Wildcat
had been driven out of the Big Green
Woods forever.</p>

circus tent, &#8220;and strong as strong, I
wouldn&#8217;t stay in a
cage and go round
with a circus. I&#8217;d
live in the woods.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If <i>I</i> was a tiger,&#8221; echoed Nancy, &#8220;and
could creepy-crawl like a big cat, I&#8217;d
never let &#8217;em put <i>me</i> in a circus.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;d like to know why they&#8217;re
all here,&#8221; said Mother, with a smile,
&#8220;we&#8217;ll stop on the way home and buy
Elizabeth Gale&#8217;s stories about <i>How the
Animals Came to the Circus</i>, Warner
Carr drew the pictures and Rand McNally
&amp; Company made the book, and
we can get it at any shop for 50 cents.&#8221;</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve known Tom, the Piper&#8217;s son,
for a long, long time, but did you ever
know that he had a
pet cat which fiddled
so merrily that
even the King just
couldn&#8217;t keep his
feet still? And did
you know that Little Miss Muffet had
a Mother who had an Aunt who could
be cured of a sick-a-bed illness only by
eating hot buttered muffins? And did
you know&mdash;O, ever so many more things
about your Mother Goose friends? If
you didn&#8217;t, let Louise A. Garnett and
James McCracken tell you in The <i>Merrymakers</i>.
Rand McNally &amp; Company
have made their rimes and pictures into
a book which you may buy in the shops
for $1.00.</p>

<p>Perhaps you didn&#8217;t
know it, but the Little
People who are so busy
making the seed babies
lie straight in their
beds and driving off
Jack Frost when he wants to nip the
snowball blossoms love to talk to all
children. But many children&mdash;would
you believe it?&mdash;shut their ears and
eyes and never hear them or even see
them. Loraine was different, and they
told her the most delightful things.
Maybe it will help <i>you</i> to see and hear
these Little People if you read about
them in a book called <i>Loraine and the
Little People of Spring</i>. Elizabeth Gordon
and Rand McNally &amp; Company
made the book, which you may buy in
any bookstore for 50 cents.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
